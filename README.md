# VulnDrivers
this repo holds entries for vulnurable drivers i decided to reverse engineer on my own, these are usually based on logical vulnurabilities that were caused by bad driver writing skills. i also document some general RE on drivers that may not be vulnurable in my journey to try and find a zero-day vulnurability in
some kind of system component in windows 10 :)

Zero days discovered: 0.5
